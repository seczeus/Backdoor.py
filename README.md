# Backdoor.py
Backdoor made on python. Alpha version working and tested on Linux and Windows still with some directory bugs.
Feel free to contribute with the project.

To install dependent libraries:
:~/sudo apt-get install python-pip3
:~/pip3 install colorama

On Windows, you only need to have python interpreter correctly installed on your system and type on CMD:
>pip3 install colorama
